Welcome to the Dice Duel Game! This interactive web application lets you engage in an exciting dice-based showdown between two players. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an engaging and enjoyable user experience.

How to Play:
  1. Open the webpage to start the game.
  2. You will see two dice, one for each player (Player 1 and Player 2), displayed on the screen.
  3. The dice values are generated randomly every time the page is loaded or refreshed, simulating the roll of actual dice.
  4. The objective of the game is simple: the player with the higher value on their dice wins.
  5. If the value on Player 1's dice is greater than that on Player 2's dice, Player 1 wins. Conversely, if Player 2's dice value is greater, Player 2 wins.
  6. To determine the winner, simply refresh the page to generate new dice values. The updated winner will be displayed accordingly.
